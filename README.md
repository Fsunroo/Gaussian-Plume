## About ##


Contaminants discharged into the air are transported over long distances by large-scale air-flows and dispersed by small-scale air-flows or turbulence, which mix contaminants with clean air. This dispersion by the wind is a very complex process due to the presence of different-sized eddies in the atmospheric flow. Due to this complexity, there is no complete theory that establishes the relationship between ambient conditions of air pollutants and the causative
meteorological factors and processes.

So, to express all these to the extent possible, we make models (simplified picture of reality).
* An atmospheric dispersion model is a mathematical simulation which governs the transport, dispersion and transformation of pollutants in the atmosphere.
* Nowadays air pollution models are computer programs that use mathematical algorithms to simulate how pollutants in the ambient atmosphere disperse and, in some cases, how they react in the atmosphere, using information on the:
    * Contaminant emission rate
    * Characteristics of the emission source
    * Local topography
    * Meteorology of the area
    * Ambient or background concentrations of pollutant

The process of air pollution modelling contains four stages (data input, dispersion calculations,deriving concentrations, and analysis). The accuracy and uncertainty of each stage must be
known and evaluated to ensure a reliable assessment of the significance of any potential
adverse effects.
